This is a website that I made for my UX Design class. The overall project was mainly about designing a website and showing users feedback and incorporating said feedback into a new design. This was my first time using Figma and my first time using React and Tailwind in my tech stack. I had been using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript prior.
